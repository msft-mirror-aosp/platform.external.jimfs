description:
    "Jimfs is an in-memory file system for Java 7 and above, implementing the "
    "java.nio.file abstract file system APIs. "
    "Note that it may not directly mimic all file system behavior (e.g. SELinux "
    "access control, emulated storage, etc.). The initial intention to add this "
    "project to Android is to fake host side disk access in unit tests, and not "
    "the device itself."
